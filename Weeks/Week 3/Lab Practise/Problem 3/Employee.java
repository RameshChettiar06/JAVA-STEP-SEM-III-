/*a. Create an Employee class with private variables: empId (String), empName (String),
department (String), baseSalary (double), empType (String), and static variable
totalEmployees (int)
b. Create multiple constructors for different employee types: constructor for full-time
employees, constructor for part-time employees, constructor for contract employees
c. Create overloaded methods calculateSalary(): one for full-time (base salary +
bonus), one for part-time (hourly rate Ã— hours), one for contract (fixed amount)
d. Create overloaded methods calculateTax() with different tax rates for different
employee types
e. Create methods generatePaySlip() to display employee details with calculated
salary and tax, displayEmployeeInfo() for formatted output
f. Create static methods to track total employees and generate company-wide payroll
reports
g. In main, create different types of employee objects, demonstrate method overloading
by calling the same method names with different parameters */
